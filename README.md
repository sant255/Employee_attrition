# Employee_attrition
Employee Attrition analysis

open jupyter notebook
import packages for attrition analysis
import packages of pandas, numpy, linear model, metrics, preprocessing, model selection .
read a csv file on employee attrition
data cleaning process: drop unwanted columns, check missing values, fill nan values
encoding the data
using label encoder to encoding the text data
using ML model to find employee attrition
split the data into value and target
visualize the count of value and target
find correlation
split the data into training and testing data
using logistic regression to find the accuracy 
if the accuracy percentage in more than 85% the model will be perfect
using ML model to find performance rating
split the data into value and target
visualize the count of value and target
find correlation
split the data into training and testing data
using logistic regression to find the accuracy 
if the accuracy percentage in more than 85% the model will be perfect
if the accuracy will less than 85% then the other ML model would be decision tree classification.
open the streamlit app - spyder
write the code to find the attrition and performance rating
then the output will be predicted.
